# OLD
Decided to revisit this project after several months, want to take a better approach so will be starting this project from scratch

# CoffeeBeans
Messing around with java to potentially create a 2D game engine that can replicate old school 2D games.
Took a long time out of personal projects and wanted to get into something in my free time. 
Decided to use Java as it was the first programming language I had experience with and what ignited my passion for programming. Maybe one day ill finish my C++ engine...
